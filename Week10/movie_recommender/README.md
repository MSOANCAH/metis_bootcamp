# What should we watch tonight?  A Movie Recommender System

For this project, I built a movie recommender based on the idea that people with similar tastes as ours may also like similar movies.  This is known as a collaborative filtering based approach to recommendation.  The data source I used to build my recommender is the MovieLens 20 Million Dataset, which consist of 20 million ratings of movies.

This repo is still under construction and I will have a much cleaner version very soon.  Thanks for your understanding.
