    "1. I recommended the move \"Bandit Queen\" even though only one user had given it a rating.  I think I should throw out any movie that hasn't been rated more than X times.  Perhaps X=5?  The only problem is that once I filter out these movies, then my Y and R matrices will have a new index to movie mapping.  Try to find a solution to this problem.\n",
    "1. To be a decent recommender system, I need to be able to take into account the actual user preferences.  For instance, since I don't like violence, I really don't want my recommender system to recommend any violent films.  How to implement this?\n",
    "1. I'm getting different results every time I run my recommender system.  I think the reason for this is (a) I'm using a different seed for theta and X every time and (b) it doesn't appear that my gradient decent algorithm is converging.  Ask Robert his thoughts on this."
