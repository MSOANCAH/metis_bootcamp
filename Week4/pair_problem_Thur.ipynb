    "Imagine there are 100 people in line to board a plane that seats 100. The first person in line realizes he lost his boarding pass so when he boards he decides to take a random seat instead. Every person that boards the plane after him will either take their \"proper\" seat, or if that seat is taken, a random seat instead.\n",
