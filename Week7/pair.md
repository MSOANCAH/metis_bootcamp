# Pairs

Today's pair is a non-technical, individual session. Write your responses inline, and post them to Slack if you feel comfortable

## Looking back

### What has helped you consume and understand concepts, over the past 7 weeks?

I have found that the pair problems, challenge questions, and projects have all been important for me to consume and understand concepts.  I also have found that discussing hard to understand topics with my cohortmates has also been insightful.  

### What topic was the biggest 'unexpected winner', or the topic you didn't know existed but really enjoyed?

I found deep learning and the tools to run deep learning models to be super interesting! 

## Now

### What has gone well with your project 4?

I'm still collecting data, so I'm feeling kind of neutral about project 4.

### What about building this project would you like to do better next time?

Maybe finding a dataset that has more raw text in which I could run some deep learning models on.

## Looking forward

### What most excited you about project 5?

Obviously, we haven't begun project 5 yet, but I'm excited to dive deeper into a topic that really interests me that perhaps could also interest some employers.

### What sort of job would you like to have after Metis?

I would be really excited to find a job that could combine some hardware development and data science.  One such example would be to work for an Internet of Things startup.  I'm going to try to look at other startups as well.  I also plant to apply to jobs at some of the big companies like Google, Apple, Netflix, and GE.

### What skills are the required skills for that job? What are the preferred skills for that job?
