For this project, I examined recipes from around the world through the lens of a data scientist. I was really interested to see if I could learn something about the relationships of different cuisines throughout the world. In order to explore this topic, I chose to use recipe data. In particular, I used the list of ingredients for ~12,500 different recipes that I acquired from [Yummly](https://developer.yummly.com/) using their API.  Thanks to Yummly for providing me a student license to their API!

**Repository Structure**

* yummly: Consists of a few different iPython notebooks which contain the scripts and functions I used for this project.  
    - yummly_EDA.ipynb: Notebook which goes through requesting data from the Yummly API and saving to to a pandas Dataframe.
