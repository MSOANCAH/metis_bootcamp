For this project, I examined recipes from around the world through the lens of a data scientist. I was really interested to see if I could learn something about the relationships of different cuisines throughout the world. In order to explore this topic, I chose to use recipe data. In particular, I used the list of ingredients for ~12,500 different recipes that I acquired from [Yummly](https://developer.yummly.com/) using their API.  Thanks to Yummly for providing me a student license to their API!

**Repository Structure**

* yummly: Consists of a few different iPython notebooks which contain the scripts and functions I used for this project.  
    - yummly_EDA.ipynb: This notebook contains the code I used to query the yummly api.  The recipe data is saved into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.
    - yummly_Modeling.ipynb: This notebook contains the NLP and unsupervised machine learning analysis code.  Here you will find all the pretty figures that I generated for this project.
    - yummly_final.ipynb: This notebook is still a work in progress.  This will contain my consolidated code in a much more concise and readable format.  To be completed soon.
* presentation: Slide deck which provided an overview of my project.
* mvp: Contains the document describing my minimum viable product.
* summary: Contains a brief summary document describing the goals of my project, the methods used, and some key results.
