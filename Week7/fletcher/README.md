For this project, I examined recipes from around the world through the lens of a data scientist. I was really interested to see if I could learn something about the relationships of different cuisines throughout the world. In order to explore this topic, I chose to use recipe data. In particular, I used the list of ingredients for ~12,500 different recipes and ran several machine learning models.
