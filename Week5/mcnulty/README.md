# The Prediction of Mushroom Edibility Using Machine Learning

This project is associated with the classification of mushrooms based on their edibility, that is being poisonous or non-poisonous. I wanted to see if we can classify mushroom edibility based on some key features, such as cap color, gill color, spore print color, or odor.  To explore this question further, I utilized the [UCI mushroom data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom).

**Repository Structure**

* code: Consists of iPython notebook which contains the scripts and functions I used for this project.
