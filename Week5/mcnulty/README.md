# The Prediction of Mushroom Edibility Using Machine Learning

![Meadow mushroom](/presentation/presentation_images/Agaricus_campestris(fs-05).jpg)

This project is associated with the classification of mushrooms based on their edibility, that is being poisonous or non-poisonous. I wanted to see if we can classify mushroom edibility based on some key attributes, such as cap color, gill color, spore print color, or odor.  To explore this question further, I utilized the [UCI mushroom data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom).

**Repository Structure**

* code: Consists of iPython notebook which contains the scripts and functions I used for this project.
* presentation: Slide deck which provides an overview of my project, including major findings.
* mvp: Contains the document describing my minimum viable product.
* summary: Contains a brief summary document describing the goals of my project, the methods used, and some key results.
